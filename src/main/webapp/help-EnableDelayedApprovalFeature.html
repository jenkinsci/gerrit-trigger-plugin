Check this box to enable the Delayed Approval Feature. Beware, this is an experimental feature. To use, in the advanced properties of a job's gerrit trigger, select "Delayed Approval". Once that job is finished, its result wont be sent to Gerrit. Instead, this will be done by another Jenkins job, which must have a post-build action to "Send a delayed approval", with the job name and buld number set accordingly. Beware that if the delayed approval is not sent, memory use of Jenkins will grow over time, until Jenkins is restarted. If Jenkins is restarted before a delayed approval is sent, it won't be sent after the restart either.
