Host representing the slave, typically hostname or hostname:port. This must be the same as value of targetNode in the Gerrit ref-replicated event.<br/>

<b>Limitation:</b> Gerrit is setting the targetNode to the value of the host part of the url in the replication configuration so this
feature do not support replication using file protocol since there is not host.
