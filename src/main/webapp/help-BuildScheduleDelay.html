<p><strong>Build Schedule Delay</strong> delays the scheduling of the build by the specified number of seconds. The default <strong>Build Schedule Delay</strong> is 3 seconds.
A longer delay can be needed if the changes are to be built from Gerrit mirrors, since the replication takes time. However, if you are using replication events to trigger your jobs, you may set this value to 0 to disable the <strong>Build Schedule Delay</strong></p>
