Replication cache expiration time in minutes<br>
<br>
If one of the server supports replication events, these events are cached in memory because they can be received before
the build is triggered and this plugin gets called to evaluate if the build can run. Cache allows the plugin to look if
the replication events were already received when it gets called to evaluate if the build can run. If the time elapsed
between this plugin gets called and the time the build entered the queue is greated than the cache expiration time, the
plugin will assume that replication events were received and will let the build run.<br>
