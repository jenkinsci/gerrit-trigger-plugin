Insert all jobs on which this job depends.
If a commit should trigger both a dependency and this job, the dependency will be built first.
Use commas to separate job names. Beware of cyclic dependencies.

With this option enabled the parent builds are available as Env variables for the build<br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>DEP_KEYS</b>="Space separated list of all key names of triggered parent projects"</li>
    <li><b>DEP_&lt;project name&gt;_BUILD_NAME</b>="The build name of triggered project"</li>
    <li><b>DEP_&lt;project name&gt;_BUILD_NUMBER</b>="The build number of triggered project"</li>
    <li><b>DEP_&lt;project name&gt;_BUILD_RESULT</b>="The build result of triggered project"</li>
</ul>
The project key name is produced from full project name using simple regular expression:
    <b>replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]+", "_")</b>.
So, all non-alphanumerical characters will be replaced by "_".
