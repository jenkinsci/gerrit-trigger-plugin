    <b>Important note when using Replication:</b>
    <br/> <br/>
    Please note that you may require the View Drafts permission within Gerrit<br/>
    in order to have this trigger work consistently.<br/>
    <br/><br/>
    This permission should be applied for the user that is connecting to Gerrit as<br/>
    specified with the Gerrit Server configuration section.<br/>
    <br/><br/>
    If you do NOT have the permission defined, the Gerrit Trigger may not be able to<br/>
    see certain events and therefore cause builds to timeout waiting for the replication<br/>
    to complete. <br/>
