Sets silent mode to on or off.
When silent mode is on there will be no communication back to Gerrit,
i.e. no build started/failed/successful approve messages etc.
If other non-silent jobs are triggered by the same Gerrit event as this job,
the result of this job's build will not be counted in the end result of the other jobs.
