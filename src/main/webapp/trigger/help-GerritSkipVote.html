    If a build result should be counted towards the total or not.
</p>
<p>
    &quot;Skipping&quot; the vote means that if more than one build of this job is triggered by a Gerrit event
    the outcome of this build won't be counted when the final vote is sent to Gerrit.
</p>
<p>
    If this is the only build that is triggered then the vote will be 0.
