<strong>Specify what Gerrit project(s) to trigger a build on.</strong>
<p>
    At least one project and branch pattern needs to be specified for a build to be triggered,
    and you can specify as many Gerrit projects to trigger on as you want.
</p>
<p>
    Start by specifying the name of the Gerrit project in the left hand text field.
    You can specify the name pattern in three different ways, as provided by the &quot;Type&quot; drop-down menu.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Plain:</strong> The exact name in Gerrit, case sensitive equality.</li>
    <li><strong>Path:</strong> ANT style pattern. <i>Ex: &quot;**/base/*&quot;</i></li>
    <li><strong>RegExp:</strong> Regular expression. The expression should match the whole line, so to use the example
                with base above, .*\/base\/?.*</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Then provide the name of the branch(es) to trigger on. The same "pattern types" are available as above.
    So for example to trigger on all branches in the project you can specify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Path</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> **</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can add more branch patterns by clicking on &quot;Add Branch&quot;
</p>
<p>
    Then you can optionally provide the name of the specific file path(s) and topic names to trigger on.
    <ul>
        <li>To only trigger builds if the patch set contains files in a certain folder.</li>
        <li>To only trigger builds if the change belongs to a topic.</li>
    </ul>
    The same "pattern types" are available as above. If no file paths are added,
    all files will trigger a build. (same as topic.)

<p>
    So for example to trigger on all files in any folder structure under a sub-folder called java:
</p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Path</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> **/java/**</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can add more file path patterns by clicking on &quot;Add File path&quot;
</p>
<p><strong>Disabling strict forbidden file verification</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Enabling this option will allow an event to trigger a build if the event contains <strong>BOTH</strong> one or more wanted file paths <strong>AND</strong> one or more forbidden file paths. </li>
  <li>In other words, with this option, the build will not get triggered if the change contains only forbidden files, otherwise it will get triggered.</li>
</ul>
