Click "Add time" to add a time span on the format <i>hh:mm</i> during which the watchdog should not be active each day.
If not alot of events happen during certain times, this is useful for reducing the amount of unnecessary connection restarts.<br>
If an exception is to be made spanning from before midnight to after midnight, please add 2 exception times, one up to midnight
and one from midnight onwards. The plugin doesn't currently handle times like "from 23:00 to 01:00".
