This plugin integrates Jenkins to
https://www.gerritcodereview.com/[Gerrit code review] for triggering
builds when a "patch set" is created.

== Set Up

=== Gerrit access rights

Gerrit has a special access-group "Service Users" for CI systems and
other bots. We recommend that you add your jenkins user in Gerrit to
this group.

. Create the profile through in _Gerrit web interface_ for your Jenkins
user, and set up a _SSH key_ for that user.
. Gerrit web interface > Browse > Groups > Service Users > Add
your jenkins user.
. Browse > Repositories > ... > Access > Edit
* Reference: `+refs/*+`
** *Read*: ALLOW for Service Users
* Reference: `+refs/heads/*+`
** *Label Code-Review*: -1, +1 for Service Users
** *Label Verified*: -1, +1 for Service Users

Gerrit documentation:
https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.4.1/access-control.html#service_users
https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.4.1/access-control.html#examples_cisystem

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before Gerrit v3.3 the CI group was named "Non-Interactive Users".

https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.3.html#schema-changes

As a member of "Service Users" group jenkins will get "Stream Events"
capability, without this, the plugin will not work.

https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.4.1/access-control.html#capability_streamEvents
====

=== Administrative Settings

Specify the Gerrit server settings via "Manage Jenkins > Gerrit Trigger"

Fill in the server settings:

image:images/server-settings.png[Server settings]

Click "Test Connection" to verify the connection.

When everything seems ok, save your settings and restart the connection
in the "Control" section at the bottom of the page:

image:images/trigger-server-control.png[server control]

There are many more settings for your pleasure, look at the individual
help sections for information what they are about.

=== Trigger Configuration

In the "Build Triggers" section of your Job configuration page; tick
"Gerrit event":

image:images/gerritconf.PNG[Job trigger configuration]

Specify what type of event(s) to trigger on:

* *Draft Published:* Sent when a change moves from draft state to new.
(Support for draft removed in Gerrit v2.15).
* *Patchset Created:* Sent when a new patchset arrives on a change.
* *Change Merged:* Sent when a change is merged on the Gerrit server.
* *Comment Added:* Sent when a comment is added to a change. Which
category and value to trigger on can be configured. The available
categories can be configured in the server settings for the plugin.
* *Ref Updated:* Sent when a ref is updated on the Gerrit server, i.e.
someone pushes past code review.

https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2.15.html#support-for-draft-changes-removed

_If you don't specify any event; Patchset Created and Draft Published
(if available) will be selected by default._

image:images/commentadded.PNG[Comment added configuration]
_Comment added configuration._

Specify what Gerrit project(s) to trigger a build on.

At least one project and branch pattern needs to be specified for a
build to be triggered,and you can specify as many gerrit project to
trigger on as you want.

Start by specifying the name of the Gerrit project in the left hand text
field. +
You can specify the name pattern in three different ways, as provided by
the "Type" drop-down menu.

* *Plain:* The exact name in Gerrit, case insensitive equality.

* *Path:* http://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns[ANT style
pattern]. Ex: "***/base/**"

* *RegExp:*
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Regular
expression].

Then provide the name of the branch(es) to trigger on. The same "pattern
types" is available as above. +
So for example to trigger on all branches in the project you can
specify: +
  Type: Path +
  Pattern: ** +
You can add more branch patterns by clicking on "Add Branch" and more
projects by clicking "Add Project".

The same syntax works for specifying which file(s) to trigger on (this
is only available in version 2.3 or higher of Gerrit).

==== Dynamic triggering

From version 2.6.0 of the plugin, a new way of configuring what
projects, branches and files to trigger on is available. +
 
image:images/dynamictriggerconfig.PNG[Dynamic Trigger Configuration]
By checking the checkbox "Dynamic Trigger Configuration", the user is
asked for the URL to a file.

On a set interval, the plugin fetches and parses this file. The file
contents should follow this syntax:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
p=some/project
b^**/master/*
t~.*
h~.*
f~.*\.txt
p=some/other/project
b^**
----

Explanation:

p for project +
b for branch +
t for topic +
h for hashtags +
f for file +
= for plain syntax +
^ for ANT style syntax +
~ for regexp syntax

Branch and file lines are assumed to be part of the closest preceding
project line.

The dynamic triggering can be used in combination with the usual
configuration, described above. The gerrit trigger will

trigger both for the dynamic and non-dynamic configurations.

The interval on which Jenkins fetches the file is configurable in the
administrative pages for the Gerrit trigger, under advanced:

image:images/refreshconfig.PNG[Dynamic trigger refresh]

NOTE: Anonymous user must have READ permissions to Jobs in order for
this feature to work.


===== Use case

The reason for this functionality is that a user would want to update a
list of what to trigger on outside of Jenkins.

Another use case is to run a build in Jenkins periodically that creates
the list, then have several projects use the same list.

===== *Gerrit hooks*

Gerrit doesn't use the standard repository hooks. To do an automatic
update of jenkins on a patch you'll need to install the "hooks" plugin
and add a hook to the top-level gerrit hook directory ($site_path/hooks).

The equivalent of a git 'post-receive' hook for gerrit is a
'patchset-created' handler.  More info on gerrit hooks can be found
here:

https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/hooks/

=== Usage with the Git Plugin

To get the Git Plugin to download your change; set Refspec to
*$GERRIT_REFSPEC* and the Choosing strategy to *Gerrit Trigger*. This
may be under ''Additional Behaviours/Strategy For Choosing What To
Build' rather than directly visible as depicted in the screenshot. You
may also need to set 'Branches to build' to *$GERRIT_BRANCH.* If this
does not work for you set Refspec to
*refs/changes/*:refs/changes/** and 'Branches to build' to
*$GERRIT_REFSPEC*.

NOTE: Be aware that *$GERRIT_BRANCH* and *$GERRIT_REFSPEC* are not set
in the *Ref Updated* case. If you want to trigger a build, you can set
Refspec and 'Branches to build' to *$GERRIT_REFNAME*.

image:images/git_config.png[Git Configuration]

=== Usage with Repo

If you are using a freestyle project and repo to download your code it
would be as "easy" as.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
repo init -u git://gerrit.mycompany.net/mymanifest.git
repo sync
repo download $GERRIT_PROJECT $GERRIT_CHANGE_NUMBER/$GERRIT_PATCHSET_NUMBER
----

=== Missed Events Playback Feature (Available from v. 2.14.0)

NOTE: This feature replaces the "Check Non-Reviewed Patchsets" option that was
part of a Job's Gerrit Trigger configuration.

If your Jenkins instance has been down for a period of time (upgrade or
maintenance), the Missed Events Playback Feature ensures that any missed
events are re-played and builds are triggered.

The mechanics are as follows:

* The Playback Manager maintains a last known alive timestamp of events
that were received by the Gerrit Server connection.
* Upon re-connect, a request is made to the Gerrit Events-Log plugin
installed on the Gerrit Server to determine which events may have been
missed while the connection was down.
* The events are then added to the Gerrit Trigger event queue to be
processed.

==== Setup Requirements

The Playback Manager requires:

* The REST api to be configured for the Gerrit Server Connection.
* The Gerrit Events-log plugin must be installed on the Gerrit Server
(Please see https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/events-log/)

===== Setting up the REST api

* To setup the REST api for the Gerrit Server Connection, navigate to
*Manage Jenkins > Gerrit Trigger* and click on the *Edit* icon for the
Server Connection.
* Click on *Advanced*, and enter the *Gerrit HTTP User* and *Gerrit HTTP
Password* values as shown below.

image:images/Playback-REST-Api.png[Playback REST Api]

* Click on *Test REST Connection* to verify the user and password
settings.
* Click on *Save*
* Restart the connection using the *Status* icon in the Server Table
shown below:

image:images/GerritServerRestartIcon.png[Restart Gerrit Server connection]

===== Gerrit Server Events-Log plugin

Gerrit Server Events-Log plugin

NOTE: Please note that if the Gerrit Server Events-Log plugin is not installed
on the *Gerrit Server*, then the Playback Manager will be disabled.


* Please see https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/events-log/ for
installation details.

==== Verifying functionality

* Once you have restarted the connection, click on the *Edit* icon in
the Server Table. If there is a problem with the Playback Manager's
configuration, you will see this:

image:images/PlaybackWarning.png[Playback Warning]

* If the Playback Manager is correctly setup, you will see the following
in the Jenkins log file when the Gerrit Server Connection is started:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
INFO: (8) missed events to process for server: defaultServer ...
----

== Skip Vote

"Skipping" the vote means that if more than one build is triggered by a
Gerrit event the outcome of this build that "skips its vote" won't be
counted when the final vote is sent to Gerrit. If this is the only build
that is triggered then the vote will be 0.

This can be useful if you have one job that triggers on all patch set
created events that just checks that the commit message is correctly
formatted, so it should only deny merging if it is a bad commit message
but also not allow the merge just because the message was ok. In that
scenario you could configure the "check commit message" job to skip
voting on Successful.

== Pipeline Jobs

Version 2.15.0 of the Gerrit Trigger plugin supports Jenkins Pipeline
job types. So as with the traditional job types, this plugin supports:

. Triggering of Pipeline Jobs based on Gerrit Event notifications e.g.
the Patchset Created event.
. Checkout of the change-set revision from the Gerrit Git repository.
See example below.
. Sending of the "build completed" command to Gerrit (with Verified
label etc).

The plugin doesn't currently offer a dedicated DSL syntax for performing
the change-set checkout. However, it's very easy to perform the checkout
using the Gerrit parameters provided to the build, along with the
existing Workflow step for Git (or other supported SCM) e.g.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
node {
  // Checkout the Gerrit git repository using the existing
  // workflow git step...
  git url: '<gerrit-git-repo-url>'

  // Fetch the changeset to a local branch using the build parameters provided to the
  // build by the Gerrit plugin...
  def changeBranch = "change-${GERRIT_CHANGE_NUMBER}-${GERRIT_PATCHSET_NUMBER}"
  sh "git fetch origin ${GERRIT_REFSPEC}:${changeBranch}"
  sh "git checkout ${changeBranch}"

  // Build the changeset rev source etc...
}
----

Note though that with this approach the changelog will not show
correctly.

== Declarative Pipeline Jobs

You can configure the pipeline checkout in the job configuration to use the
"Gerrit Trigger with merge commit support" choosing strategy. This strategy
behaves similar to the original "Gerrit Trigger" strategy with the exception
that for change-merged events where Gerrit automatically creates a merge commit,
it will select the revision for the merge commit rather than the revision for
the patchset that was submitted. This ensures that the Jenkinsfile is checked
out correctly in the event the Gerrit resolved a merge for that file. See
https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-65481 for all the details.

Configure your job as normal for patchset-created and change-merged event triggers then use
the following settings in the Pipeline section of your job configuration
(you can use a similar setup for freestyle jobs):

Definition: Pipeline script from SCM
 - SCM: Git
   - Repositories
     - Set your repository URL and credentials
     - Name: origin
     - Click the "Advanced" button
     - Refspec: $GERRIT_REFSPEC +refs/heads/$GERRIT_BRANCH:refs/remotes/origin/$GERRIT_BRANCH
   - Branches to build
     - Branch specifier: refs/heads/$GERRIT_BRANCH
   - Additional Behaviours
     - Strategy for choosing what to build: Gerrit Trigger with merge commit support

then in your Jenkinsfile pipeline code rely on the automatic checkout or disable the automatic checkout and use
"scm checkout" as shown below:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
pipeline {
  options {
      skipDefaultCheckout true
      // ...
  }
  stages {
    stage('checkout') {
      checkout scm
    }
    //...
  }
}
----

This method of skipping the default checkout is useful if you want to checkout into a subdirectory of your
workspace by wrapping the checkout in a dir directive, for example:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
dir("${env.WORKSPACE}/scm") {
  checkout scm
}
----

== Tips & Tricks

This section contains some useful tips and tricks that users has come up
with. Feel free to add your own.

=== Using "Build Now"

Normally when you have configured a job to be triggered by Gerrit you
can't use the "Build Now" link anymore since your builds are dependent
on information from Gerrit, especially if you are using the Git plugin
to checkout your code in the workspace.

You can get around this limitation if you for example want to use the
same job to build the master branch at some point. If you are using the
Git plugin do the following

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
Add a String parameter called GERRIT_REFSPEC with the default value refs/heads/master
----

Using this trick will enable you to build, but no results will be sent
to Gerrit since it is not triggered by it.

=== Multiple jobs review the same changeset (possibly giving different answers)

That's possible, see
http://strongspace.com/rtyler/public/gerrit-jenkins-notes.pdf

=== Reduce number of notification emails

Since the trigger adds a comment in Gerrit for each build start and end,
usually all the reviewers get a notification email. This can get quite
annoying. However, it's possible to configure Gerrit so that only the
change owner and people who starred the change get a notification email.
To do this DENY the 'Email Reviewers' capability for the Gerrit user
that is used by Jenkins. See
https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/access-control.html#capability_emailReviewers.

=== Verified label

You need to ensure that a Verified label is configured in Gerrit,
otherwise the Gerrit Trigger will fail to submit votes for jobs, due
to the invalid label.

https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.4.1/config-labels.html#label_Verified

Alternately, you can remove the verified flag from the command used to
submit votes for changes, and simply have the trigger submit code review
votes:

. Go to "Manage Jenkins" and click the "Gerrit Trigger" link
. Under "Gerrit Servers" next to your server(s) click the "Edit" button
(looks like a gear, other icons may overlap it)
. Under "Gerrit Reporting Values" click the Advanced button at the
bottom
. Under "Gerrit Verified Commands" remove the '--verified <VERIFIED>'
sections from each command, see screenshot
