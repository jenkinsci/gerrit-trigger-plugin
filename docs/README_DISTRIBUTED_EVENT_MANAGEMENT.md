# Distributed Event Management support

The plugin supports Distributed Event Management support where two or more replicas or nodes of a logical Jenkins(*) instance
run in parallel (sharing the Gerrit memory of the plugin). When enabled, a Hazelcast
cluster coordinates the instances so that:

- Each Gerrit event is processed by **exactly one** instance (event claiming)
- Build state is shared across instances (distributed build memory)
- Gerrit feedback (votes and comments) are sent **exactly once** per build event

By default, the plugin runs in **local mode** and requires no additional configuration.
Local mode is fully backward-compatible with single-instance Jenkins deployments.

Alternative coordination backends can be implemented by extending
[`CoordinationModeProvider`](../src/main/java/com/sonyericsson/hudson/plugins/gerrit/trigger/spi/CoordinationModeProvider.java)
— a Jenkins `ExtensionPoint` that wires together the storage, event-claiming, and
notification-claiming strategies for a given coordination mode. A higher `@Extension`
ordinal takes precedence over the built-in Hazelcast provider.

## Hazelcast implementation

Hazelcast mode is activated via a JVM system property. Jenkins connects as a lightweight
client to a Hazelcast sidecar container, reusing the cross-pod cluster the sidecar
maintains.

### Configuration Properties

All distributed storage settings are controlled by JVM system properties passed to Jenkins on startup.

| Property | Default | Description                                           |
|---|---|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `gerrit.trigger.coordination.mode` | `local` | Set to `hazelcast` to enable distributed coordination |
| `gerrit.trigger.coordination.hazelcast.client.addresses` | `localhost:5702` | Comma-separated `host:port` list of sidecar addresses |
| `gerrit.trigger.coordination.hazelcast.client.cluster.name` | `gerrit-trigger-cluster` | Cluster name to connect to                            |

Port `5702` is used by default to avoid potential conflicts with other Hazelcast cluster, which could occupy port `5701`.

Cluster name must be different for each logical instance. Multiple replicas or nodes of a logical instance may configure the same cluster name. Different logical instances require separate cluster names.

### Configuration Example

#### Kubernetes — Client Mode with Hazelcast Sidecar

The plugin can connect to Hazelcast cluster as a lightweight client. For example, if we are running 
K8s environment with the Jenkins instance inside a pod, we can have a side-container with Hazelcast
to set up the Hazelcast cluster. In this kind of cases, we would the a configuration setup similar
to the following one:

Add the following JVM arguments to the Jenkins instance:

    -Dgerrit.trigger.coordination.mode=hazelcast
    -Dgerrit.trigger.coordination.hazelcast.client.addresses=localhost:5702
    -Dgerrit.trigger.coordination.hazelcast.client.cluster.name=gerrit-trigger-cluster

Add the sidecar container to the instance pod spec:

```yaml
- name: hazelcast
  image: hazelcast/hazelcast:5.3.8
  ports:
    - containerPort: 5702
      name: hazelcast
  env:
    - name: JAVA_OPTS
      value: >-
        -Dhazelcast.config=/dev/stdin
        -Dhazelcast.local.publicAddress=$(POD_IP):5702
    - name: HZ_CLUSTERNAME
      value: gerrit-trigger-cluster
    - name: HZ_NETWORK_PORT_PORT
      value: "5702"
```

Grant the pod's service account read access to Kubernetes endpoints so Hazelcast can
discover its peers:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: hazelcast-gerrit-trigger
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["endpoints", "pods", "nodes", "services"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
  - apiGroups: ["discovery.k8s.io"]
    resources: ["endpointslices"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

#### Kubernetes — Client Mode with Separate Hazelcast Cluster

For larger deployments or strict separation of concerns, you can decouple the coordination layer by running a standalone Hazelcast cluster. Jenkins still connects as a lightweight client, but routes traffic to the separate cluster via a Kubernetes service instead of a sidecar.

Add the following JVM arguments to the Jenkins instance, updating the client address to point to your standalone Hazelcast Kubernetes service (replace hazelcast-service.default.svc.cluster.local with your actual service DNS and namespace, along with the cluster name for your logical instance):

    -Dgerrit.trigger.coordination.mode=hazelcast
    -Dgerrit.trigger.coordination.hazelcast.client.addresses=hazelcast-service.default.svc.cluster.local:5702
    -Dgerrit.trigger.coordination.hazelcast.client.cluster.name=gerrit-trigger-cluster-<LOGICAL_INSTANCE_NAME>

In this topology:
- You do not need to add the sidecar container to the Jenkins pod spec.
- The Jenkins service account does not need RBAC permissions for peer discovery, as cluster management is handled entirely by the standalone Hazelcast nodes.
- You must deploy and manage the Hazelcast cluster independently (e.g. via the official Hazelcast Helm chart), ensuring you configure it to match your expected `HZ_CLUSTERNAME` and port (`5702`).

## AMQP event delivery requirements

In an HA (multi-replica) deployment, Gerrit events are typically delivered to Jenkins via the
[RabbitMQ Consumer plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/rabbitmq-consumer/), which this plugin
integrates with via
[`RabbitMQMessageListenerImpl`](../src/main/java/com/sonyericsson/hudson/plugins/gerrit/trigger/impls/RabbitMQMessageListenerImpl.java).
That class reconstructs each event's Gerrit server identity entirely from AMQP message headers.

### The `gerrit-name` header is strictly required

Every AMQP message carrying a Gerrit event must include a `gerrit-name` header whose value matches
the name of a configured `GerritServer` in Jenkins. This is not optional in an HA setup:
[`PluginImpl#getServer(GerritTriggeredEvent)`](../src/main/java/com/sonyericsson/hudson/plugins/gerrit/trigger/PluginImpl.java)
resolves the event's `GerritServer` purely from this header, and if it is missing, empty, or does
not match a configured server name, resolution returns `null`. Only a warning is logged
(`Could not find server config for ... - no such server.`) — no exception is thrown and nothing is
surfaced to the operator.

Event-scoped processing that depends on identifying the originating Gerrit server — including
`BuildMemory#cancelOutdatedEvents()`, which aborts a job's previous, superseded-patchset build when
a new patchset event arrives — does not run once server resolution fails. A missing `gerrit-name`
header therefore causes outdated-build cancellation to silently do nothing: builds for
superseded patchsets are left running instead of being cancelled, and event deduplication breaks
in the same silent way.

Whatever component publishes Gerrit stream events onto the AMQP broker (e.g. a stream-events-to-AMQP
bridge) must be configured to set `gerrit-name` to the exact `GerritServer` name configured in
Jenkins for every message it publishes.

### Exchange type and per-replica queues

The RabbitMQ Consumer plugin does not declare or bind any exchange or queue itself — the operator
provisions them and configures a fixed queue name per consume item. This has direct consequences for
the HA event-claiming model described above, which depends on **every** replica receiving **every**
event so that exactly one of them can claim it:

- Each Jenkins replica must consume from its **own dedicated queue**, and that queue must receive a
  copy of every published event. A `fanout` exchange — or a `topic` exchange with a routing key that
  matches all per-replica queue bindings — satisfies this, since every queue bound to the exchange
  gets its own copy of each message.
- Do **not** point multiple replicas at the same queue name, and do not rely on a `direct` exchange
  with a single shared queue across replicas. Standard AMQP competing-consumer semantics apply to any
  queue: only one consumer receives each message. If replicas share a queue, most events reach only
  one replica; if that replica happens to be down, the event is never claimed by any surviving
  replica, defeating the purpose of running more than one.
