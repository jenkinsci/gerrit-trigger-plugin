<p>Sets the filename within the workspace from which to retrieve the unsuccessful review message.</p>

<p>This can be useful if you have various build steps, each of which may have its own reason for failing a build.
In cases like this, you can cause the failing build step to describe the reason for the failure in full detail, and
place that failure reason into a text file, prior to marking the build as failed.  Then when reporting back to Gerrit,
the plugin will read the contents of that file and use that as the build failure message that gets posted to the review.</p>

<p>
   Can use wildcards like 'module/dist/**/*.zip'.
   See <a href='http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html'>the @includes of Ant fileset</a> for the exact format.
   The base directory is <a href='ws/'>the workspace</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Build variables in the message text will be expanded.
  Jenkins supplies some <a href="../../env-vars.html" target="_blank">environment variables</a> that can be used in the file's contents.
</p>

<p>For example:<br />
<quote>
  <b>Build Step: Execute Shell</b>
  <pre>
    ${WORKSPACE}/bin/run-unit-tests.sh 2>build-error_${BUILD_NUMBER}.txt
  </pre>
</quote>
If the <tt>run-unit-tests.sh</tt> script fails (returns a non-0 exit code), and also outputs an error message to STDERR,
the build will be marked as failed, and the STDERR output will be sent to <tt>build-error_&lt;BUILD_NUMBER&gt;.txt</tt>.
That error content then becomes the failure message that is added in the gerrit review comment.</p>
