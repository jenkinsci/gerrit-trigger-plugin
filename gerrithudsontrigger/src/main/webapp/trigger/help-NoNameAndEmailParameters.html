<p>
  In some configurations parameters containing both a name and an email address can cause problems.
  It can be difficult to have these escaped to the satisfaction of all tools in a build chain.
  Turning this setting on allows these parameters to be omitted.
</p>
<p>
    E.g. parameters like this will not be created:<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;-DGERRIT_PATCHSET_UPLOADER="Joe Coder" &lt;jcoder@some.where&gt;
</p>
<p>
 <i>Triggers configured before this setting was introduced
     will have this unchecked, giving the same behavior as before by
     creating those parameters.</i>
