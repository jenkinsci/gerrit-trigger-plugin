Select this option to prevent Jenkins from sending the approval at the end of this build. A post-build "delayed approval" will be necessary to have the result sent back to Gerrit. Beware: this is an experimental feature. If a needed delayed approver is not run (job failure for instance), the delayed job will consume memory until Jenkins is restarted.
