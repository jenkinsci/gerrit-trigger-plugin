<strong>Specify what Gerrit project(s) to trigger a build on.</strong>
<p>
    At least one project and branch pattern needs to be specified for a build to be triggered,
    and you can specify as many Gerrit projects to trigger on as you want.
</p>
<p>
    Start by specifying the name of the Gerrit project in the left hand text field.
    You can specify the name pattern in three different ways, as provided by the &quot;Type&quot; drop-down menu.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Plain:</strong> The exact name in Gerrit, case sensitive equality.</li>
    <li><strong>Path:</strong> ANT style pattern. <i>Ex: &quot;**/base/*&quot;</i></li>
    <li><strong>RegExp:</strong> Regular expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Then provide the name of the branch(es) to trigger on. The same "pattern types" are available as above.
    So for example to trigger on all branches in the project you can specify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Path</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> **</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Select "Rebuild on approve" checkbox to retrigger build of the latest patchsets on all open Gerrit changes
    when a patchset is approved and merged to a branch matching the pattern specified. Only changes for the
    branch modified will be rebuild.
</p>
<p>
    You can add more branch patterns by clicking on &quot;Add Branch&quot;
</p>
<p>
    Then you can optionally provide the name of the specific file path(s) to trigger on.
    E.g. to only trigger builds if the patch set contains files in a certain folder.
    The same "pattern types" are available as above. If no file paths are added,
    all files will trigger a build.

<p>
    So for example to trigger on all files in any folder structure under a sub-folder called java:
</p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Path</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> **/java/**</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can add more file path patterns by clicking on &quot;Add File path&quot;
</p>
