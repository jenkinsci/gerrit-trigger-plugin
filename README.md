# Gerrit Trigger Plugin

This plugin triggers builds on events from the Gerrit code review system by
retrieving events from the Gerrit command "stream-events", so the trigger is
pushed from Gerrit instead of pulled as scm-triggers usually are.

Various types of events can trigger a build, multiple builds can be triggered
by one event, and one consolidated report is sent back to Gerrit.

Multiple Gerrit server connections can be established per Jenkins instance.
Each job can be configured with one Gerrit server.

# Environments
* `linux`
    * `java-1.7`
        * `maven-3.3.3`

* Java 1.7: minimum development environment.
* Java 8: Works.
* Java 6 Runtime compatible

You should have no problem running the plugin on a Windows server.

The maintainers' development, tests and production environments are
Ubuntu so we have no means of detecting or fixing any Windows issues.

Java 6 compatibility will be dropped as soon as newer core version is needed for features.

# Build

The plugin depends on a [gerrit-events](https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/gerrit-events) component
that used to be part of this project but later broken out. Although we will try to avoid it,
sometimes you might need to _mvn install_ it locally if dependant changes there haven't been released yet.

The _(build-config)_ directory contains "special" CheckStyle configurations and the build will
fail during the verification phase if you don't follow them.

    mvn clean package
    
Run findbugs for future reference or to make sure you haven't introduced any
new warnings

    mvn findbugs:findbugs

Run checkstyle

    mvn checkstyle:checkstyle

# Test local instance

To test in a local Jenkins instance

    mvn hpi:run
